                        Fashion is Art and Clothes are your Canvas. Fashion Design is a multidimensional profession that
                        involves the seamless blend of one’s design skills and creative imagination. It is an art that
                        involves designing clothes keeping in mind the consumer’s tastes and preferences. At DRS MEDIA &
                        DESIGN SCHOOL, We encourage our students to come up with creations that are fashion-forward and
                        wearable but at the same time giving them the space to visualize and create unconventional and
                        out-of-the-box garments.
