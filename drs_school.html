                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Darussalam English School provides an engaging and challenging learning environment where students
                    are encouraged to excel intellectually, academically and socially.</p>
                <p>We believe that all students have the potential to be active, independent thinkers and learners.
                    Confidence and motivation are the seeds of life-long learning and with these, education can be an
                    exploration of ideas and values. Student engagement is critical to inspire students to pursue their
                    own interests and push their personal limits of achievement. An effective education must prepare
                    students with the skills needed for success in an ever-changing world.</p>
